# Welcome to etiquetado

`etiquetado` provides an API and APPs to annotate research data automatically with metadata and notes, as well as a means to export such data as frictionless based [unitpackages](https://echemdb.github.io/unitpackage/).

The repository is currently under construction, containing several non-organized Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks.
